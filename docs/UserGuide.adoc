Our team is still working on the User Guide.
Keep a look out for more cool and exciting features coming soon!

== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook!
TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3).
TimeBook is a scheduling application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends.
It also can find the common free time and venues among the user and his or her friends.
TimeBook will have the following features:

. A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
. Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
. Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
. Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
. Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.

== Understanding this guide

=== Basic Information

This guide explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the <<Quick Start, *quick start section*>> and general *lifecycle* usage of our application.
If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our <<FAQ,*Frequently Asked Questions*>> (FAQ) is here to address that.
If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hop right into using the application by looking at our <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>>.
Otherwise, take a look at the <<Inexperienced CLI user, *Inexperienced CLI User*>> section to obtain more information on how to use our application.

We have used the following symbols to help you better understand our application usage.
(For now we have not picked our symbols yet.)

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `timebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TimeBook.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all information in TimeBook.
* *`addperson`* `n/John Doe p/98765432 em/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the TimeBook.
* *`deleteperson`* `n/John Doe` : deletes the person named `John Doe` from the TimeBook.

* *`addtogroup`* `n/John Doe` `g/CS2103` : Adds a person `John Doe` into the group `CS2103`.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Inexperienced CLI user

Unlike most applications, where you use your mouse to interact with the application such as scrolling and clicking, our application mostly use the *Command Line Interface*.
Most of the time, you would be interacting with the application through typing commands in the command box of the application.

You can play around with the commands in <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>> to get yourself warmed up.

== GUI Components

In this section, you will learn more about the different components of our application.
Here is an overview of all of the components in our application:

image::guiComponents.png[]

=== MenuBar

You may use the menu bar to access file or exit the application.

image::menuBar.png[]

=== Schedule Display

The schedule display is the main component that you will be looking at to look schedules of yours or others!

image::scheduleDisplay.png[]

==== How to read the schedule view

Unsure of how to read the combined schedules of your friends in TimeBook? Here is a simple example to guide you!

TimeBook ensures that the leftmost column will always start from today's date. Each unnumbered coloured block belongs to
someone's schedule in the group. For example, the image below highlights all of Charlie's schedule.

image::charlieBusyTimeslot.png[]

Take note of the numbered green boxes you see below!

image::freeTimeslot.png[]

These are the common free time slot that you and your group members share! You can use
these numbered green boxes to arrange your meetings or share it with your group members to pick.

=== Tabs

Tabs will contain your contacts and your groups.
You can use it to see all your existing contacts and groups!

image::tabs.png[]

=== Result Display Box

This box shows you whether your command executed is successful or unsuccessful.
If you encounter an error message here, look at our errors meaning section to see what is the cause of error.

image::resultDisplayBox.png[]

=== Command Box

Type your commands here to execute them!

image::commandBox.png[]

=== Suggestions Autocomplete

TimeBook comes with a helpful feature that provides suggested commands or relevant values so you can spend less time typing commands and more time on your group meetings.

When you type a command, TimeBook will show a dropdown with similarly matching commands.
For example, you type in the command `add`.
TimeBook will then suggest commands such as `addevent`, `addgroup`, `addperson` like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step1.png[width=50%]

If you meant to type the `addevent` command, you can immediately select it by pressing the kbd:[Tab] key.
Otherwise, you can pick other options by using the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow keys and then hit the kbd:[Tab] key to confirm your selection.
For now, try selecting the `addtogroup` command.
TimeBook will complete the command like this:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step2.png[width=50%]

*****
image:./icons/lightbulb.png[] You can type an abbreviated version of the command as long as the letters are in order!
For example, instead of typing `addtogroup`, try `atg`.
*****

Remember how TimeBook can also suggest relevant values?
Let's try that by specifying a person's name using the `n/` parameter like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step3.png[width=50%]

Again, TimeBook provides useful suggestions, in this case, the names of the people we've previously added.
Now, try using the kbd:[Tab] key to immediately fill in "Bobby".

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step4.png[width=50%]

Now, let's complete the `addtogroup` command.
Let's add Bobby to the Friends group by typing `g/` and using the suggestions to help us pick the Friends group.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step5.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step6.png[]
|=======

Let's say we change our mind and don't want to add Bobby to the Friends group.
No problem, just remove Bobby's name and pick someone else using the familiar kbd:[Up], kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys.
TimeBook is smart enough to only fill in the name parameter and won't mess up the rest of your command.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step7.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step8.png[]
|=======

Congratulations!
You've now mastered the suggestions feature using just three simple keys, the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys to navigate between suggestions and the kbd:[Tab] key to select it. +
The following sections will explain all the commands we have in TimeBook and what they do.

=== Closest Common Location

TimeBook will also help you to decide where to meet for your project meetings by suggesting to you where is the closest location for everyone to meet in NUS based on their schedule.

*Steps*

. Setup your group by:
.. Adding your group members to your TimeBook with `addperson` command
.. Adding your group to TimeBook with `addgroup` command
.. Add your group members to your group with `addtogroup` command
. Find the free common time when you want to meet with `show` command
. With the free time slot `id` get the details for the closest common location with `popup` command
. Press `esc` button to close the popup

*Constraints*

Due to the lack of internet connectivity, TimeBook will only support locations that are in NUSMods and identifiable by Google Maps.
The full list of the supported locations is below.

*Definitions*

. We define closest common location as the location that requires the least average distance to travel to from different sources by car.
. Locations that are not supported are voided and are not used for the calculations of the closest common location and average travelling distance.
. Refer to the `Developer Guide` on how we compute the closest common location.

==== Closest Common Location Popup `popup`

command: `popup g/ GROUP_NAME i/ID`

image::gmaps/SuccessfulPopup.png[SuccessfulPopup]

[#img-SuccessfulPopup]
.An example of a popup when `popup` is executed

_Description_

When the command is executed a popup will appear that shows the all the information of the closest common location for a particular free time slot in a group.

_Parameters_

. `GROUP_NAME`
- Description: This is the name of the Group you want to find the free time for.

`groups` tab in the user interface.(Use `switch-tab` if your tab is on persons)
- Type: `String`
. `ID`
- Description: This is the `id` of the free time slot of a group.
You can get this `id` from the user interface when you use `show g/[groupname]` command.
You can only enter the `id` that is shown on the screen.

.. First choice represents the first closest and so on and so forth.
.. The average distance(m) to reach the various location will be displayed below the respective choices.
.. A list of voided location that TimeBook does not support will be shown at the bottom of the popup.
. The picture of the closest common location on google maps will be shown on the left of the popup.
Where the marker represent the exact location of the first closest common location.

_Failure Response_

. `Error` when all the source locations are not recognised by TimeBook, a popup will not appear.
.. Feedback box will show: `We could not find a common location because all places cannot be found in NUS. The locations are:`
. `Error` when all the group members are not in school before the free time slot, a popup will not appear.

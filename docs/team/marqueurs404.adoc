== PROJECT: TimeBook

---

== Overview

TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). TimeBook is a scheduling application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends. It also can find the common free time and venues among the user and his or her friends.

This document summarizes my contributions to the TimeBook project in terms of the code, user guide and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

This section documents a summary of the major and minor contributions I have made to this project.

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *the ability to add NUSMods timetables to schedules*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to add their own NUSMods timetables by providing their NUSMods link or by adding individual modules.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly given our target user of busy NUS undergraduates as they can quickly setup their timetable just by using pre-existing data from NUSMods rather than creating their own schedule from scratch.
** Highlights: This implementation was challenging as it required the development of a new API component to query, transform and store external data. Extensive checks have to be done to make sure the data is correctly handled. It also required an analysis of multiple design alternatives in order to find a balance between the complexity of the implementation and robust offline support. A caching mechanism to store query results and a pre-processing program was written to store all relevant NUSMods data for offline support.
** Credits: The https://api.nusmods.com/v2/[NUSMods API] was used for retrieving NUSMods data. The https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/[JSON.simple library] was used to encode and decode the JSON data that was retrieved from the NUSMods API.

//* *Minor enhancement*: added a `calendarinvite` command that allows the user to quickly create a google calendar event with all the details of the meeting filled in and the members in the group invited, to quickly notify the members of the scheduled meeting.

* *Code contributed*: See on https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=marqueurs404&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=zoom[Reposense]
